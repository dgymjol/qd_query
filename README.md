----------
## Updates & News 
* Charades-STA experiments with C3D features are actually conducted with I3D features and I3D benchmarking tables.
Features are provided [here](https://app.box.com/s/h0sxa5klco6qve5ahnz50ly2nksmuedw) from [VSLNET Github](https://github.com/26hzhang/VSLNet/tree/master).
Sorry for the inconvenience.
* Our new paper on moment retrieval and highlight detection is now available at [[CG-DETR arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08835) (Correlation-guided Query-Dependency Calibration in Video Representation Learning for Temporal Grounding). Codes will be soon available at [[CG-DETR Github]](https://github.com/wjun0830/CGDETR).

## Prerequisites
<b>0. Clone this repo</b>

<b>1. Prepare datasets</b>
> (2023/11/21) For a newer version of instructions for preparing datasets, please refer to [CG-DETR](https://github.com/wjun0830/CGDETR).

<b>QVHighlights</b> : Download official feature files for QVHighlights dataset from Moment-DETR. 

Download [moment_detr_features.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hiln02F1NEpoW8-iPZurRyi-47-W2_B9/view?usp=sharing) (8GB), 
extract it under '../features' directory.
You can change the data directory by modifying 'feat_root' in shell scripts under 'qd_detr/scripts/' directory.
```
tar -xf path/to/moment_detr_features.tar.gz
```


<b>TVSum</b> : Download feature files for TVSum dataset from UMT.

Download [TVSum](https://connectpolyu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/21039533r_connect_polyu_hk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2F21039533r%5Fconnect%5Fpolyu%5Fhk%2FDocuments%2FZoo%2FReleases%2FUMT%2Ftvsum%2Dec05ad4e%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2F21039533r%5Fconnect%5Fpolyu%5Fhk%2FDocuments%2FZoo%2FReleases%2FUMT&ga=1) (69.1MB),
and either extract it under '../features/tvsum/' directory or change 'feat_root' in TVSum shell files under 'qd_detr/scripts/tvsum/'.


<b>2. Install dependencies.</b>
Python version 3.7 is required.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For anaconda setup, please refer to the official [Moment-DETR github](https://github.com/jayleicn/moment_detr).

## QVHighlights

### Training
Training with (only video) and (video + audio) can be executed by running the shell below:
```
bash qd_detr/scripts/train.sh --seed 2018
bash qd_detr/scripts/train_audio.sh --seed 2018
```
To calculate the standard deviation in the paper, we ran with 5 different seeds 0, 1, 2, 3, and 2018 (2018 is the seed used in Moment-DETR).
Best validation accuracy is yielded at the last epoch. 

### Inference Evaluation and Codalab Submission for QVHighlights
Once the model is trained, `hl_val_submission.jsonl` and `hl_test_submission.jsonl` can be yielded by running inference.sh.
```
bash qd_detr/scripts/inference.sh results/{direc}/model_best.ckpt 'val'
bash qd_detr/scripts/inference.sh results/{direc}/model_best.ckpt 'test'
```
where `direc` is the path to the saved checkpoint.
For more details for submission, check [standalone_eval/README.md](standalone_eval/README.md).


### Pretraining and Finetuning
Pretraining with ASR captions is also available.
To launch pretraining, run:
```
bash qd_detr/scripts/pretrain.sh 
```  
This will pretrain the QD-DETR model on the ASR captions for 100 epochs, the pretrained checkpoints and other experiment log files will be written into `results`. 
With the pretrained checkpoint, we can launch finetuning from a pretrained checkpoint `PRETRAIN_CHECKPOINT_PATH` as:
```
bash qd_detr/scripts/train.sh  --resume ${PRETRAIN_CHECKPOINT_PATH}
```
Note that this finetuning process is the same as standard training except that it initializes weights from a pretrained checkpoint. 

## TVSum
Training with (only video) and (video + audio) can be executed by running the shell below:
```
bash qd_detr/scripts/tvsum/train_tvsum.sh 
bash qd_detr/scripts/tvsum/train_tvsum_audio.sh 
```
Best results are stored in 'results_[domain_name]/best_metric.jsonl'.



### Others
- Pretraining with ASR captions
- Runninng predictions on customized datasets

are also available as we use the official implementation for Moment-DETR as the basis. 
For the instructions, check their [github](https://github.com/jayleicn/moment_detr).
